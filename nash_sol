The Queue Interface is a part of java.util package and extends the Collection interface. It stores and processes the data in an order where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.

Key Features
FIFO Order : Elements are processed in the order they were inserted (First-In-First-Out).
No Random Access : Unlike List, elements cannot be accessed directly by index.
Multiple Variants : Includes PriorityQueue, Deque, ArrayDeque and LinkedList implementations.
Two Sets of Methods : Throws-exception versions (add, remove, element) and safe versions (offer, poll, peek).

Declaration of Java Queue Interface
The Queue interface is declared as:

public interface Queue extends Collection

We cannot instantiate a Queue directly as it is an interface. Here, we can use a class like LinkedList or PriorityQueue that implements this interface.

Queue<Obj> queue = new LinkedList<Obj>();

Now let us go through a simple example first, then we will deep dive into the article.

Example: Basic Queue using LinkedList

import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

public class hft {
    
  	public static void main(String args[]) 
    {
        // Create a Queue of Integers using LinkedList
        Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
        
        System.out.println("Queue elements: " + q);
    }
}
